## What is Vue?

> Vue is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale
> between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an
> ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

### What does that mean?

-   Views are pure HTML combined with Javascript expressions {{ }} and directives comparable with Angular. ngFor == v-for. Makes use of a virtual DOM like React
-   Works with a single file component principle. HTML, JS and CSS in a single Vue.component file
-   Reactivity system based on ES6 Proxies (since v3, v2 uses Object.defineProperty/Getters/Setters)
-   Tightly integrated and well maintained ecosystem.
    -   vuex
    -   vue-router
    -   vue-cli (wow!)
    -   vue-devtools (chrome addon)
    -   many more
-   Has many control libraries such as Vuetify, Quasar, Element UI, Bootstrap, Vue Material, UI5 webcomponents...
-   Support for Typescript (improved in v3)

### Vue / SAP UI5

-   Opiniated frameworks
-   Two-way binding
-   Vue is very light weight (core is 10kb) , whereas UI5 is not.
-   Vue is 100% opensource
-   Performance difference
